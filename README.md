**[Consistent cross-modal identification of cortical neurons with coupled autoencoders](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43588-021-00030-1)**

### Abstract

Consistent identification of neurons in different experimental modalities is a key problem in neuroscience. While methods to perform multimodal measurements in the same set of single neurons have become available, parsing complex relationships across different modalities to uncover neuronal identity is a growing challenge. Here, we present an optimization framework to learn coordinated representations of multimodal data, and apply it to a large multimodal dataset profiling mouse cortical interneurons. Our approach reveals strong alignment between transcriptomic and electrophysiological characterizations, enables accurate cross-modal data prediction, and identifies cell types that are consistent across modalities.
